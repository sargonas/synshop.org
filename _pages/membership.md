Please <a href="https://membership.synshop.net/signup">create an account</a> (you'll need to verify your email) to get started.

# Membership Guidelines

#### Regular Memberships
Membership to SYN Shop is $50 per month. This gives you access to all of the collaboration areas, the classroom, the electronics lab and the shop WiFi during normal operating hours. You will also have voting rights on all regular shop matters.

You must complete a very quick and to-the-point Tool Certification (TC) before you can operate the bigger / more expensive equipment on your own. Our goal isn't to be the mean and grumpy shop teacher, but we want to make sure that you aren't going to damage the tool or hurt yourself. We have designed TCs to give you a reference on how to operate the tool safely and properly.

<mark><b>Members must also follow our first rule, "Don't be a jerk"</b></mark> as well the others we have <a href="/assets/pdf/SYN Shop Rules v3 2020-08-12.pdf">published here</a>.  Furthermore, the shop <a href="/assets/pdf/SYN Shop Bylaws - 2020-02-01.pdf">has bylaws</a> which govern how we operate.

#### Vetted Memberships
Once you have be a member of SYN Shop for a while and feel like you are really contributing to the space, you can apply for Vetted Membership status. Vetted Membership status gives you access to the shop 24/7 in addition to the benefits of being a Regular Member. 

To become a vetted member, your application will be reviewed by the board of directors for approval. The board would love to give everyone vetted membership immediately, but we want to make sure you are going to help protect the reputation of SYN Shop and be super passionate about building an awesome community of Makers.

#### Drop-in Memberships
We don't have drop-in memberships at this time, but we are always willing to give a tour of the space during normal operating hours. Classes are always open to the public.

#### Collaboration with Non SYN Shop Members
Hey, we know that from time to time you will be working on a project that involves non SYN Shop members. When doing so, you are welcome to host up to two guests. We do ask that they consider giving a general donation to SYN Shop (or become members) if they are going to be using the space a considerable amount.

#### Liability Wavier
Please print, sign and return <a href="/assets/pdf/SYN-Shop-Liability-Waiver-Members.pdf">this waiver to SYN Shop</a>.  You can submit it by either emailing a scanned copy to <a href="mailto:info@synshop.org">info@synshop.org</a> or bring it down to the shop and we'll file it away for you.

#### Tool Certifications
You must complete a very quick and to-the-point Tool Certification (TC) before you can operate the bigger / more expensive equipment on your own. Our goal isn't to be the mean and grumpy shop teacher, but we want to make sure that you aren't going to damage the tool or hurt yourself. We have designed TCs to give you a reference on how to operate the tool safely and properly.
